Bifurcation Diagram Example
Based on the quadratic family

Dimension: 2

Initial values: (x1,x2) = (0.3, 0)

Final expressions:
(x1,x2) = (4 * x2 * x1 * (1-x1), x2)

Scale:
x2 from 0 to 1
x1 from 0 to 1

Point count: (100, 1000000)

Piece of Code (1,1000)
x1=0.3; x2 += 0.001;

color: 200
